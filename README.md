# Vacation Lighting Simulator (Hubitat)

**Vacation Lighting Simulator** is a smart and flexible occupancy-simulation app for **Hubitat Elevation**.  
It helps your home look lived-in while you're away by turning lights on and off in a realistic, human-like pattern — using randomized cycles, anchor lights, time-window restrictions, and intelligent scheduling.

This app is optimized specifically for Hubitat’s automations model, event-driven architecture, and lightweight Groovy runtime.  
It is fast, dependable, and configurable for both simple and advanced use cases.
