You should now be all set! Please note, however, that events will populate the bucket automatically as new events happen on your Hubitat network. Your history of events will build from when you setup the SmartApp forward, so, if you don't see any events in your Initial State bucket immediately, it's most likely because no events have occurred just yet!

#### Virtual Dew Point is a fork of the fabulous work by [`JohnRob`](https://community.hubitat.com/t/my-first-app-and-how-i-stumbled-through-it-long-read/44611) with minimal changes/bug fixes to get it to run on my Hubitat.
